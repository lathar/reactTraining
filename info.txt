Day 1

1. Installing the softwares
2. Basic html
3. undefined -> not declared 
document -> document object model
window.onload => on refer to microsoft introduced, can't do unregister
window.addEvenListener => has removeEvent Listener
caniuse.com, website to find the speed of javascript  --?
bracket.io -> use to complier js on the fly by adobe
to validate json -> jsonlint.com
browser js render -> IE it is chakara , firefox it is monkey , chrome it is V8 engine
councerrency replays with promise awaits
es5 & es6 ( it is standard version of es5)
Block scope
-----------
hosting -> host flag :)
let and const - block scoping, this also hosting but it create object in temporaral dead zone.
const -> collections can update using const by adding or remove but not able to delete.
in javascript collections are dynamic.
javascript is single threaded. webworker create pesudo mulitple threaded. (javascript by docuglers)
De structuring
--------------
Differnt way of assigning variable
if the name is match  of object then assign to same key
function
--------
functions are object in JS
if function assign to variable it will hosted
undefined concat to number is nan
arguments attribute in function is depecarted
rest arguments ( ...[variablename]) like ...nums , nums is variable name
rest and spread operators
 rest -> ...number in the function defining parameters function test(...number) {}
 spread -> ...param while calling/ invoking the function. tets(...param);
spread can use only used for arrays
lexical scope 
function are object it call be called by obj.call() or obj.apply() or obj.bind()() 
call() -> it takes as context followed by parameters required 
apply () -> it takes as context followed by array of parameters
bind() -> it takes as content and while calling we have to pass the parameters
call(),apply(),bind() is replaced by arrow scope
arrow functions uses the scope of the parent

mutable objects and immutable -?
Objects are default mutable. to change immutable prev it is another js used 
but es6 has this feature present.
3 differnt wyas to create object
    -> var obj = {} //empty obj
    -> var obj = new Object();
    -> var obj = Object.create(); //immutable objetcs


interfaces -?
css -> verrtical margin collapse
template string => using of ``
class 
-----
prototype -> it is a empty object in a object , we can append anything we needed
inside a class all the methods are public
class will not allow to have var or let
to have a private variable it can be declared as ._ like this._variablename
compiler -> take the code and converted to machinie understand language
transpiler -> take js and return js like es6 to es5 eg:bable, tracer
composition -> ?
closure - > ?

Day2
----
oreally forum
js conf / js foo

Nodejs -> server side JS
express js -> it is Javascript module to serve files
middleware js -> things happen btw equest and response
react -> build component
react-dom -> render the modules
react-script -> complier using bable
differnt ways to import
import react from <react module> // inside module if there is any [class export default ] then this way used
import {react} from <react module> // inside module if class is just export then [export class] then {} used with same name as export
html 5 has webcompoent which allowed to create the custom tags

To change port 
go to -> node_modules/react-scripts/start.js

To create the react project
1. install react --> npm install -g create-react-app 
2. create application --> create-react-app <application name> 
3. cd <application name>
4. start happy coding ... :)
5. to install routing use " npm i react-router-dom "
6. npm i axios  -> to fetch the data
