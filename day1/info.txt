Day 1

1. Installing the softwares
2. Basic html
3. undefined -> not declared 
document -> document object model
window.onload => on refer to microsoft introduced, can't do unregister
window.addEvenListener => has removeEvent Listener
caniuse.com, website to find the speed of javascript  --?
bracket.io -> use to complier js on the fly by adobe
to validate json -> jsonlint.com
browser js render -> IE it is chakara , firefox it is monkey , chrome it is V8 engine
councerrency replays with promise awaits
es5 & es6 ( it is standard version of es5)
Block scope
-----------
hosting -> host flag :)
let and const - block scoping, this also hosting but it create object in temporaral dead zone.
const -> collections can update using const by adding or remove but not able to delete.
in javascript collections are dynamic.
javascript is single threaded. webworker create pesudo mulitple threaded. (javascript by docuglers)
De structuring
--------------
Differnt way of assigning variable
if the name is match  of object then assign to same key
function
--------
functions are object in JS
if function assign to variable it will hosted
undefined concat to number is nan
arguments attribute in function is depecarted
rest arguments ( ...[variablename]) like ...nums , nums is variable name
rest and spread operators
 rest -> ...number in the function defining parameters function test(...number) {}
 spread -> ...param while calling/ invoking the function. tets(...param);
spread can use only used for arrays
lexical scope 
function are object it call be called by obj.call() or obj.apply() or obj.bind()() 
call() -> it takes as context followed by parameters required 
apply () -> it takes as context followed by array of parameters
bind() -> it takes as content and while calling we have to pass the parameters
call(),apply(),bind() is replaced by arrow scope
arrow functions uses the scope of the parent
mutable objects and immutable -?
interfaces -?
css -> verrtical margin collapse
template string => using of ``
class 
-----
prototype -> it is a empty object in a object , we can append anything we needed
inside a class all the methods are public
class will not allow to have var or let
to have a private variable it can be declared as ._ like this._variablename
compiler -> take the code and converted to machinie understand language
transpiler -> take js and return js like es6 to es5 eg:bable, tracer
composition -> ?
closure - > ?
