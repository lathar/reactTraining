--------------
Differnt way of assigning variable
if the name is match  of object then assign to same key
function
--------
functions are object in JS
if function assign to variable it will hosted
undefined concat to number is nan
arguments attribute in function is depecarted
rest arguments ( ...[variablename]) like ...nums , nums is variable name
rest and spread operators
 rest -> ...number in the function defining parameters function test(...number) {}
 spread -> ...param while calling/ invoking the function. tets(...param);
spread can use only used for arrays
lexical scope 
function are object it call be called by obj.call() or obj.apply() or obj.bind()() 
call(),apply(),bind() is replaced by arrow scope
arrow functions uses the scope of the parent
mutable objects and immutable -?
